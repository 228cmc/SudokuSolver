    "# Solving Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to walk through the process of building a Sudoku solver that can handle puzzles of varying difficulty. The approach relies on classical AI methods, particularly backtracking search with constraint checking, which are common techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be writing an agent that can solve sudoku puzzles. You should be familiar with sudoku puzzles from the unit material. You are given a 9x9 grid with some fixed values. To solve the puzzle, the objective is to fill the empty cells of the grid such that the numbers 1 to 9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 block of the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample puzzle along with its solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sudoku.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "We load and explore Sudoku datasets of multiple difficulty levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a robust sudoku_solver() function that can solve valid puzzles and correctly reject invalid ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We include performance checks and automated test cases to evaluate the effectiveness and correctness of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "To get started, the cell below will load in some sample sudoku puzzles for you so you can see the format. There are sudokus provided of multiple difficulties (easier sudokus typically start with more digits provided). The cell below only loads the easiest, but there is another test cell lower in the notebook which will run your code against all of the provided puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sudoku is a 9x9 NumPy array of integers, where zero represents an empty square. Each difficulty comes with 15 sudokus, so when you load the file, it is stored in a 15x9x9 array."

    "## Testing and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the Sudoku solver, we can evaluate how well it performs using a collection of puzzles categorized by difficulty: **very easy**, **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**. Each category contains 15 puzzles along with their correct solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These categories are based on reference solvers, but depending on your algorithm, some puzzles might seem easier or harder than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Invalid Puzzles\n",
    "\n",
    "From the **easy** category onwards, some puzzles may contain invalid initial states, meaning they have no possible solution.  \n",
    "In these cases, your function should return a 9x9 NumPy array filled entirely with the value `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution will be tested in stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, it will be evaluated on the same **very easy** puzzles provided in the dataset.\n",
    "- Then it will be tested on **additional hidden** puzzles from each difficulty level.\n",
    "- A correct solution must exactly match the expected result.\n",
    "- Puzzles must be solved in **under 30 seconds each**, although an average of **less than 1 second per puzzle** is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "For difficult puzzles, correctness and speed both affect the final result. The best way to improve performance is by selecting efficient AI algorithms. This task is not designed to test parallelization or low-level optimizations, but rather your understanding of algorithmic problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Test Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the test cell below to check your implementation. To activate the tests, change the value of the `SKIP_TESTS` constant to `False`.\n",
